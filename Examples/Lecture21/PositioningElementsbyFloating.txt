when you float elements, the browser takes them out of the regular document flow. 

margin collapses as we've learned before when it is touching the margin of another element. However, when it comes to floated elements, the margins never collapse. 

Q1) The following code:
			section {
 				 clear: right;
				}
says that none of the section elements should allow anything to float to the right of them.
