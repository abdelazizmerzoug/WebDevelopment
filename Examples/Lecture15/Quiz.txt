1)Question 1: By default, a block-level element tries to take up as much horizontal space as its containing element will allow: --->True


2)Question 2: Given the following HTML code:
		<body>
  			<div>Hello</div>
  			<span>World!</span>
		</body>
		div, span {
 			 background-color: blue;
			}

--->The background color behind the words 'Hello' and 'World' is blue.

--->The div element's background will span the entire width of the browser.
