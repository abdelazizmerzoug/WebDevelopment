1)Question 1: One purpose of HTML Character Entity References is
   ---> To allow the browser to display certain characters it would otherwise interpret as part of HTML code 
	   and not something to display to the user


2)Question 2: Using only HTML, how would you make sure that 3 words in an HTML document ALWAYS appear together on
	        1 line, even if the text word-wraps because the browser window is too narrow for that text line?
				--->Place &nbsp; entity reference after the 1st word and after the 2nd word 
					(with no spaces in between words and entity references)
