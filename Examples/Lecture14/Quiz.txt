1)Question 1: Given the following HTML code:
		<div>
 		        <p>I am feeling blue</p>
		</div>
		<section>
 		        <p>I just want to be left alone!</p>
		</section>
Which of the following CSS rules turns the text of the first <p> tag blue, but NOT the second <p> tag? (after all, the second one wants to be left alone.)

---> div p {
	    color: blue;
	}

---> div > p {
	    color: blue;
	}
